# GuessingGame

This is my first project utilizing C#. I undertook this mini-project as part of a course available on Udemy called "Learning to Code by Making Games - The Complete Udemy Developer".
The course is designed and taught by game developer and entrepreneur, Ben Tristem, author of "Unity Game Development in 24 Hours".
The course is designed to teach C#, the unity game engine, and programming priniciples through creating games.

OBJECT OF THIS PROJECT:
User picks a number and the program attempts to guess that number with as few guesses as possible.
